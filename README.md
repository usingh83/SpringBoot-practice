# SpringBoot-practice
Code Commit
I this repository i use Spring boot to set up a Restful API and explore the options available. I have defined Resources and GET, POST and DELETE operations for my application, and set up Exception Handling for the RESTful Web Services. Then i have implemented HATEOAS for my Resources and have explored the different approach in versioning RESTful Services and implement basic authentication with Spring Security.
I have also implement filtering and monitoring RESTful Services with Spring Boot Actuator and how to document RESTful Web Services with Swagger.I have also connected RESTful Services to a backend with JPA.
